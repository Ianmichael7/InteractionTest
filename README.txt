Interaction Toy in Python
=================

Introduction
------------

Simply put this is an interactive toy, on can move left and right using the Left and Right arrow keys, they can also jump using the space bar! I allow for continuous movement of the clouds in the sky. Touch the key and see what happens. 

In order to run, one will need both python and pyglet installed onto their computer: 
http://www.python.org/ AND http://www.pyglet.org/

They will also need two .wav sound files(Select which ever you want to hear and rename them, bgmus is background music, jump is the jump sound): 
bgmus.wav AND jump.wave
